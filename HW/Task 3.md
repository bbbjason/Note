The table presents the changes in five demographic indicators regarding population ageing in Taiwan from 2005 to 2025. The number of elderly people (aged 65+) in Taiwan will significantly grow from 2.2 million in 2005 to 4.7 million in 2025. Concurrently, Taiwan's working population (15-64 years old) has experienced an inverse shift from 16.3 million to 15.9 million. Moreover, the Potential Support Ratio, which measures retirees per working-age people, has increased from 13.6 in 2005 to 29.6 in 2025. This trend indicates that Taiwan's ageing population will likely necessitate a higher proportionate and working-age people need to support more elderly people in the future.

The findings may result from two reasons. On one hand, the medical advancements have led to enhanced healthcare quality and treatment outcomes for individuals. This improvement in medicine has contributed to an increased life expectancy and overall healthier aging population.
On the other hand, Taiwan faces sub-replacement fertility. The birth rate has been declining for many years, which means that there are fewer young people entering the population to replace the aging population. Therefore, the confluence of these two factors could contribute to the observed results.
